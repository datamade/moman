General:
 - For better unit tests for iadfa generation, we should check:
   - If we got non-final leafs nodes.
   - If we got non-reachable nodes (usually it means that we got
     deleted nodes still in the FSA).
   - If the reversed FSA is not deterministic. If it's the case
     it means that the suffixes weren't collapsed correctly.

Python:
 - Implement a faster fsa minimization algorithm.
 - Complete the IncrementalADFA class. 
 - Implement a 2-degres levenshtein-automata algorithm.

Lisp:
 - Check if the "I can add the same edge twice" behavior
   is correct.
